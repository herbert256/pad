# PAD Development

Resources for PAD framework maintainers and contributors.

## Development Resources

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [ANALYSE.md](ANALYSE.md) | Code analysis, modernization opportunities, and refactoring suggestions |
| [BUGS.md](BUGS.md) | Index of known bugs across all modules |

## Testing

The PAD reference application includes a regression test system:

- Location: `../apps/pad/regression/`
- Run via browser at `/regression`
- Compares rendered output against stored reference files

## Application Manual

The interactive manual at [../apps/pad/](../apps/pad/README.md) serves as both documentation and a working test suite with fragments covering all PAD features.

STOCKFISH BINARY PLACEHOLDER

To enable Stockfish analysis, download the Stockfish Android binary and place it here.

1. Download from: https://stockfishchess.org/download/
2. Choose the appropriate Android build for your target architecture
3. Rename the binary to 'stockfish' (no extension)
4. Place it in this folder (app/src/main/assets/)

The app will work without Stockfish, but analysis features will be disabled.

Supported architectures:
- arm64-v8a (most modern Android phones)
- armeabi-v7a (older Android phones)
- x86_64 (emulators)
- x86 (older emulators)

You can include multiple architectures by using the jniLibs folder instead:
app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/libstockfish.so
app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libstockfish.so
etc.

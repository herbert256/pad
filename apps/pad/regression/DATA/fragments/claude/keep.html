<p>
  The <code>keep</code> tag marks values to keep during sequence filtering.
</p>
<h2>
  Basic Keep
</h2>
<pre>{sequence '1..10'}
  {if $value &gt; 5}{keep}{/if}
{/sequence}</pre>
<p>
  This marks values greater than 5 to be kept.
</p>
<h2>
  Keep Even Numbers
</h2>
<pre>{sequence '1..10', push='nums'}
  {if {echo $value % 2} eq 0}{keep}{/if}
{/sequence}

{pull 'nums', keep}{$value} {/pull}</pre>
<p>
  Keep only even numbers from 1-10.
</p>
<h2>
  Keep with Condition
</h2>
<pre>{sequence '1..20'}
  {if $value &gt;= 10}
    {if $value &lt;= 15}
      {keep}
    {/if}
  {/if}
{/sequence}</pre>
<p>
  Keep only values between 10 and 15.

<h2>
  Use Case
</h2>
<p>
  Use keep when you want to filter a sequence to only include values matching certain criteria. This is part of PAD's sequence filtering system.
</p>
<h2>
  Note
</h2>
<p>
  The keep tag works during sequence iteration to mark which values should be retained when the sequence is pulled with the keep option.

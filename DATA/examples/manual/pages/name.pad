Every PAD tag gets a name, generated by PAD.<p>- Most of the time it is just the tag name<br>- Or the first parameter ( for example with the tags {tag 'content'} & {tag 'data'} )<br>- Or something else PAD thinks it is smart to use as name.</p><p>It is possible to override the name that PAD generates with the name option.</p><p>{source}{pad name='myTag'}{/source}</p>

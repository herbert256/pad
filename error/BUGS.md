No significant bugs found in this directory.

The error handling system is robust with proper try/catch nesting and fallback handlers.

## Code Quality Notes

- `padLocal()` detection is clever (checks CLI, localhost, 127.0.0.1, ::1)
- Good separation of local vs remote error display
- Proper shutdown handler to catch fatal errors

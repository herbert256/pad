Every PAD tag gets a name, generated by PAD.

<p>- Most of the time it is just the tag name
<br>- Or the first parameter ( for example with the tags {tag 'content'} & {tag 'data'} )
<br>- Or something else PAD thinks it is smart to use as name.
 
<p>It is possible to override the name that PAD generates with the name option.

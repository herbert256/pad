It's possible to put a PHP file in the directory '_callbacks' that is called back at the processing of a pad tag.<br>
- With option 'before' the callback happens for every occurrence before the processing of the ocurrences.<br>
- With option 'demand' the callback happens during the processing of the occurrences.

{/block}

{example 'callback/before', php='_callbacks/before.php', skipClose}          
{example 'callback/demand', php='_callbacks/demand.php', skipOpen}

If <b>&open;data 'xxx'&close;</b> is used, then the data will not be processed before it is stored in the data store,<br>all above examples use it in this way.</p>
<p>If <b>&open;/data 'xxx'&close;</b> is used, then the data will be processed before it is stored in the data store.<br> Below a crazy example how this can be used: <br>
- first there is a JSON data definition<br>
- then this JSON data is converted to CSV data<br>
- then this CSV data is converted to XML data<br>
- then this XML data is converted to YAML data<br>
- then this YAML data is used to show a HTML table.

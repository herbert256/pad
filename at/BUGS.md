## Issues Found

### 1. Debug Code Left in Production (`_lib/at.php:253`)
**Severity: MEDIUM**

```php
for ( $i=$pad; $i>-1; $i-- ) {
  $check = padAtGroup ( $first, $name, $names, $i+$cor );
  $GLOBALS ['a1'] [] = [$first, $names, $i, $cor, $check];  // DEBUG CODE!
  if ( $check !== INF )
    return $check;
}
```

Debug logging to `$GLOBALS['a1']` was left in production code. This pollutes global state and wastes memory.

### 2. Wrong Variable in Condition Check (`_lib/check.php:92`)
**Severity: HIGH**

```php
function padAtCheckCondition ( $part, $condition ) {
  // ...
  if ( ! padAtValid ( $part [0] ) ) return FALSE;  // WRONG! Should be $parts[0]
```

The code checks `$part[0]` (first character of the string) instead of `$parts[0]` (first element of the exploded array). This likely causes incorrect validation results.

*"parts, part... same thing, right?"*

<p>The <code>foo</code> tag is a test/placeholder tag.</p>

<h2>What Is Foo?</h2>
<p>In programming, "foo" (along with "bar" and "baz") are metasyntactic variables - placeholder names used in examples and testing.</p>

<h2>Basic Usage</h2>
<pre>{open}foo{close}</pre>
<p>Result: {foo}</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The foo tag in PAD serves as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A test tag for development</li>
  <li>A placeholder for demonstrations</li>
  <li>A simple tag for testing the tag system</li>
</ul>

<h2>In Programming Culture</h2>
<p>The terms "foo" and "bar" have been used in programming since the 1960s. They come from the military slang "FUBAR" (Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition).</p>

<h2>Common Placeholder Names</h2>
<table>
  <tr><th>Name</th><th>Usage</th></tr>
  <tr><td>foo</td><td>First placeholder</td></tr>
  <tr><td>bar</td><td>Second placeholder</td></tr>
  <tr><td>baz</td><td>Third placeholder</td></tr>
  <tr><td>qux</td><td>Fourth placeholder</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Note</h2>
<p>The foo tag is typically used for testing and doesn't have significant functionality in production code.</p>

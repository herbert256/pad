# PAD Sequence Subsystem

The sequence subsystem is a powerful mathematical sequence generation and manipulation engine built into PAD. It provides 80+ sequence types, storage/retrieval mechanisms, and transformation operations.

## Features

- **80+ Sequence Types:** Fibonacci, prime, triangular, and many more mathematical sequences
- **Sequence Storage:** Store sequences with `push` and retrieve with `pull`
- **Transformations:** Apply operations like `reverse`, `sort`, `add`, `multiply`
- **Aggregations:** Calculate `sum`, `average`, `minimum`, `maximum`, and more
- **OEIS Integration:** Fetch sequences from the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences

## Documentation

ok, time to create a more advanced web application with the PAD framework. A support website for PAD, the name of the app is 'support'. Users must create an account first. With a forum with different boards, one for installation discussions, one for PAD tags, one for the sequence subsystem. It must have a news section, that is a mini blog where the admin can post news about PAD. It also contains a ticket module where users can file bug reports, change requests. It uses a mariadb database named 'support'. Create also a mariadb sql file that creates the database, the tables, the user and place that in the _install directory. It must use the PAD templates a lot, minimal PHP code.
